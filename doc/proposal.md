# The People's Playlist

The People's Playlist is an Android application that allows users to create
an instanced lobby in which they can create a music playlist 
(such as music pulled from youtube) that will be played over
a single device/speaker.  It is a useful app for get-togethers in which guests
prefer to have music in the background but do not want one person to
be in charge of what music is being played.

A single user creates the lobby which has a unique address which
can then be shared with other users so they can connect to the lobby.
The person who creates the lobby is the designated "host" and can 
pause/play the current song.  All users (includding the host) can
add songs to the playlist (such as posting a youtube link).  The songs
in the playlist are stored in a queue and play in the order they are submitted.
To prevent one user from submitting too many songs back to back and 
essentially controlling the playlist, there is a cooldown for the submitting
user before they can submit another song.
